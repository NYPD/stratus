# stratus
SoundCloud.com is way too loud.

## What is this?
Simple chrome extension that allows you to lower the volume output on [SoundCloud](www.soundcloud.com) to levels lower than what the normal volume slider allows.

Check it out on the [chrome web store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stratus/ankobfgkkipkkdpbkgpplhjoapjkfheg)

## Why?
The volume slider they give on that page is wack. Plus other chrome extensions found on the store seemed to have too many permissions for my liking / did not work on SoundCloud.
