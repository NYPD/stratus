## What is this?
Simple chrome extension that provides more control over the volume slider than is available by the default on [SoundCloud.](https://www.soundcloud.com)

Check it out on the [chrome web store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stratus/ankobfgkkipkkdpbkgpplhjoapjkfheg)

## Why?
Soundcloud.com ~~is~~ was way too loud, now its just hard to select an appropriate volume level of your choosing.

The volume slider they give on that page makes it difficult to exactly select what you want and other chrome extensions found on the store seemed to have too many permissions for my liking / did not work on SoundCloud.

## Extension History

#### Update 2017-8-6
Extension is back up. Not as useful as v0.0.1, but hopefully will help a few people out.

#### Update 2017-5-22
Extension is fully useless. I'll look into enhancing what they have since it is a bit difficult to select an exact volume.

#### Update 2017-5-16
Looks like SoundCloud changed the way their default volume control handles, which could possibly result in this extension now being useless....
