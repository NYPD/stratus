SoundCloud is too loud man

## What is this?
Simple chrome extension that allows you to lower the volume output on [SoundCloud.](www.soundcloud.com)

## Why?
The volume slider they give on that page is wack. Plus other chrome extensions found on the store seemed to have too many permissions for my liking.
