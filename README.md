~~soundcloud.com is way too loud.~~

soundcloud.com was way too loud, now its just hard to select an appropriate volume level of your choosing.

## What is this?
Simple chrome extension that provides more control over the volume slider than is available by the default on [SoundCloud.](https://www.soundcloud.com)

Check it out on the [chrome web store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stratus/ankobfgkkipkkdpbkgpplhjoapjkfheg)

## Why?
The volume slider they give on that page ~~is wack~~ was wack. Now it is just difficult to exactly select what you want. Plus other chrome extensions found on the store seemed to have too many permissions for my liking / did not work on SoundCloud.

## Extension History

#### Update 2017-5-22
Extension is fully useless. I'll look into enhancing what they have since it is a bit difficult to select an exact volume.

#### Update 2017-5-16
Looks like soundcloud changed the way their default volume control handles, which could possibly result in this extension now being useless....
